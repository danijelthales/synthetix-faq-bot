      "value": "When you 'claim' in the Rewards tab in the staking dapp you are assigned your portion of SNX for that epoch in an escrow record in the [RewardEscrow Contract ](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb671F2210B1F6621A2607EA63E6B2DC3e2464d1F). Your rewards will not show in your wallet address, but they are assigned to your wallet address to be vested in 12 months from their claim date. However, you can still mint from those escrowed SNX because they can also be used as collateral.",
