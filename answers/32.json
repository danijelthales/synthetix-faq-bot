If the challenge period has finished (the 7+ day wait), the transfer should show up on this page with a status marked ‘Pending relay’. If you click this status bar it will pop-up a confirmation that the transaction is ready to be relayed back to Ethereum. Press the ‘Claim Withdrawal’ button which will lead you to the Etherscan page specifically for your relay transaction to then execute."
