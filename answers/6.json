      "value": "HAV tokens had a name change to SNX, and at this time all HAV holders were dropped SNX. From this point on, all HAV tokens had no market or value. So, you don’t have to convert them, you only need to get your wallet or viewer to see them, provided you haven’t already transferred/sold since. Not every cryptocurrency wallet enables all ERC20 tokens to be viewable by default.\n\nFirst check the token balance of your address on [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) to see if you actually have SNX that matches to the below contract address. If they are showing in etherscan but not in your wallet, then you’ll know it’s just that your wallet provider has not made the new SNX tokens viewable by default. If so, look for your wallet provider's help documents to find out how to add custom tokens and use the current SNX contract address below. Once your wallet can see them, you will be able to send them on or exchange them directly.\n\nAlternatively, you can go directly to the Synthetix [Staking dapp](https://staking.synthetix.io/staking) and connect your wallet, which will display your current SNX balance and enable you to participate in the native staking ecosystem if you so desire."
