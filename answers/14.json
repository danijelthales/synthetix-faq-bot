      "value": "If your C-Ratio is below the Target Collateralization Ratio (currently set at 600% for L2 and 400% for L1), you will be blocked from claiming rewards and you will need to increase your C-Ratio to claim. You can increase your C-Ratio in two ways: 1) Burning sUSD, or 2) Buying more SNX and mint more sUSD. The reasoning behind this is to incentivise the on-going correction of an under-collateralised debt pool."

    {
      "title": "Notes:",
      "value": "There is a C-Ratio to target C-Ratio tolerance of 1% with claiming to allow for some market volatility between on-chain transactions. For example, if the Target C-Ratio is 400% you can still claim in the 396-400% range.\n\nWith regard to the two options to correct, adding SNX to fix C-Ratio is much more value intensive (C-Ratio multiplier) so burning sUSD is the cheapest way to increase your C-Ratio in order to claim your Epoch rewards."
