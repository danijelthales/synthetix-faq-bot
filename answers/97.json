Itâ€™s a dApp built on the Synthetix protocol.\n\nIt was originally known as Synthetix Exchange, and was renamed to Kwenta, after community discussion and voting.  \n\nThe [Kwenta blog](https://blog.kwenta.io/) has more information and latest updates. \nYou can trade on Kwenta at [kwenta.io](https://kwenta.io/.\n\nIf you are interested in the process that led to the change, you can read this part of the original discussion by team member Garth Travers: [Renaming synthetix.exchange to Kwenta](https://research.synthetix.io/t/renaming-synthetix-exchange-discussion-of-kwenta/124/28)"
